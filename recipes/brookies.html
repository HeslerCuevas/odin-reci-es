    <h1>Brookies (Brownie Cookies)</h1>

    <P>This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she wanted 
        brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat. Since she said I should 
        just pick one, I thought this up on the way home. I couldn't find a recipe like it 
        on Allrecipes, so I created it. These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double 
        batch in a jelly roll pan.
    </P>
